How to load and use Core ML, just a simple app to use camera and identify what it is.

# What is it?
It is a real-time camera recognition, using a basic model and a smarter one to identify objects using camera

If you want to use another model try these: https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/ 
Or maybe try to train yours on your own ;)
